# Functions and Recursion Assignment

This project is a hands-on Python script that explores how functions work â€” including
parameters, default values, variable-length arguments, and recursion. It was created as part of
my **Cognizant externship** to strengthen foundational coding skills and demonstrate clean,
modular Python programming.

## Features

- Greet a user by name using a function  
- Add two numbers using a parameterized function  
- Describe a pet using default parameters  
- Build a sandwich with any number of ingredients using *args  
- Calculate a factorial recursively  
- Generate the nth Fibonacci number recursively  

## Example Output

Hello, Alice! Welcome aboard.  
The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.  
I have a dog named Buddy.  
I have a cat named Whiskers.  
Making a sandwich with the following ingredients:  
- Lettuce  
- Tomato  
- Cheese  
Factorial of 5 is 120.  
The 6th Fibonacci number is 8.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then in your terminal or command type:

python main.py or python3 main.py
